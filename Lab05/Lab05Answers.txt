trise = 155.36 - 122.5 = 32.8us
tfall = 132.1 - 102.8 = 29.3us

Vdd=5
Vth = 1.763v
tpw = 143us

Vdd=3
Vth = 1.246v
tpw = 177us

Vdd=7
Vth = 2.262v
tpw = 129us

Vdd=5 R=6.8k
Vth = 1.7v
tpw = 62ns

Vdd=5 R=30k
Vth = 1.72v
tpw = 278ns

The pulse width tpw is a little sensitive to Vdd.
The variation in tpw agree with my expectations because
tpw has a direct relationship to the resistance.
